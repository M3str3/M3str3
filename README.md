# Hello, I'm Mestre 
I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast and a self-confessed code addict. I’m convinced that tech is more than just 1s and 0s—it’s a reflection of who we are and who we strive to be (cheesy, I know).

Sometimes, I use GitHub as my personal cloud. Other times, I attempt to break what I build, or build what I break, all in the name of learning. So if my repositories look random or borderline chaotic, just consider them a testament to my constant (and slightly unhinged) experimentation.

## Why Cybersecurity?
- **Infinite Curiosity**: The field is an endless puzzle, and I’m the person who actually enjoys them.  
- **Creative Destruction**: Breaking stuff to rebuild it stronger is my idea of a good time.  
- **Keeping the World Safer**: Because letting the villainous hackers win would be too cliché.

## About Me
- **Human-Slash-Programmer**: Shifting between mortal existence and scripting reality.  
- **Night Owl**: The best ideas come right before sunrise, along with a mild existential crisis.  
- **Sarcastic & Enthusiastic**: Because a good sense of irony keeps the bugs at bay… or so I like to believe.

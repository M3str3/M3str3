# Hello, I'm Mestre
Cybersecurity enthusiast. I break things; sometimes I even fix them. You’ll probably find me at the coffee machine complaining about Java.

I sometimes use GitHub as my personal cloud. If my repos look random or borderline chaotic, take them as proof of ongoing (slightly unhinged) experiments.

Yes, I like Rust.

## Some things I’ve built (_I rarely update this. Fair warning._)

| Project      | What it is                                   | Notes                          |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **HexSpell** | Executable parsing library in Rust             | Minimal deps                    |
| **RootCause**| A SAST written in Rust                         | Rough, good for learning        |
| **Ransomware** | Full-operation simulation (blog, server config) | For learning and defense        |
